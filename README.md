# Music Genre Clustering

This project aims to analyze and cluster music genres based on their audio characteristics using a dataset of popular songs from Spotify. By leveraging clustering techniques, we can identify similarities in songs and provide personalized music recommendations.

## Problem Statement

Music streaming applications often struggle to recommend songs based on a userâ€™s taste, which is not easily discernible from their lifestyle or hobbies. By analyzing the audio features of songs a user listens to, we can group similar music genres and enhance the recommendation system.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various audio characteristics such as tempo, danceability, loudness, energy, and more for a selection of popular songs on Spotify. This information is crucial for understanding the nuances of different music genres.

## Clustering Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying key audio features that define music genres.
3. **Clustering**: Applying clustering algorithms (like K-means or hierarchical clustering) to group similar songs.
4. **Visualization**: Using plots to visualize the clusters and interpret the results.

## Results

The project successfully groups music genres based on audio characteristics, demonstrating clear similarities among songs within the same genre. This can serve as a foundation for improving music recommendation systems.
